			<!-- the problem -->
			<p> Limitations of current DNA-sequencing are preventing full access to important details of genomic information. At least 20% of our genome consists of DNA sequences that are resistant
to sequencing by current methods. These sequences are highly variable among individuals and cell types and are important markers of cellular development, aging, health, and disease.

			<!-- the solution -->
			<p> Phinomics provides products and services that integrate single-molecule/single-cell DNA-analysis
techniques with proprietary workflows, advanced bioinformatics, and leading sequencing instrumentation to uncover novel personalized details of genome structure and sequence. Our
team brings more than 30 years of research on DNA structure and properties to state-of-the-art solutions that overcome limitations in Next-generation DNA-sequencing (NGS) technologies. </p>
